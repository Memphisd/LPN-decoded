# Decoding-LPN
Repository provides implementations of:  
- MMT decoding algorithm  
- Gaussian algorithm and Prange's ISD on a generator matrix  
- BKW reduction  
- generation of a pool where last x coordinates of LPN vectors are fixed to zero  
  
The parameters have to be modified via header files. Setup scripts are coming soon.
